# RiptideNetworking

RiptideNetworking is a lightweight C# networking library primarily designed for use in multiplayer games. It can be used in Unity as well as in other .NET environments such as console applications.

Riptide provides functionality for establishing connections and sending data back and forth, leaving it up to you to decide what data you want to send and when, which is ideal if you like to be in control of your code and know what's going on under the hood.

Riptide is 100% free to use and only funded by [donations](https://github.com/sponsors/tom-weiland).

For additional information and setup instructions, see the [repo on GitHub](https://github.com/tom-weiland/RiptideNetworking).
