_description: How to install Riptide in your project.

# Installation

There are a number of ways to install Riptide, depending on what you're working on and which tools you're using.

## Unity
### Option 1: Unity Package Manager

> [!NOTE]
> Installing Riptide via Unity's Package Manager requires you to have git installed on your computer!

1. In your Unity project, open the Package Manager (Window > Package Manager).
2. Click the `+` (plus) button in the top left corner of the window.
3. Select the *Add package from git URL...* option.
4. Enter the following URL: `https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide.git?path=/Packages/Core#2.2.0`. To install a version other than v2.2.0, replace the `2.2.0` after the `#` with your chosen version number.
5. Click 'Add' and wait for Riptide to be installed.

If you have errors in your project after installation or intellisense isn't working for Riptide's classes, go to Edit > Preferences > External Tools, make sure the box next to *Git packages* is checked, and then click *Regenerate project files*.

> [!TIP]
> If you'd like to use the latest in-development version of Riptide instead of an official release, enter `https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide.git?path=/Packages/Core#unity-package` in the git URL field. Keep in mind that doing this will get you the latest state of the repository, **which may include bugs and incomplete features!**

### Option 2: DLL File

If you prefer not to use Unity's Package Manager or that option doesn't work for you, you can also install Riptide by manually adding the compiled dll file to your project.

1. Either
    - download the `RiptideNetworking.dll` file from [the latest release](https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide/releases/latest) (or choose [a previous version](https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide/releases)), or
    - clone/download the [repository](https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide) and build the solution yourself.
2. Drop the `RiptideNetworking.dll` file anywhere into your Unity project's Assets folder.
3. Optional: add the <code><a href="https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide/blob/unity-package/Packages/Core/Runtime/UnitySpecific/MessageExtensions.cs">MessageExtensions</a></code> class and add it to your project. It's included in the Unity package but isn't part of the dll file.

> [!TIP]
> It's highly recommended that you also download the `RiptideNetworking.xml` file and drop that into your project alongside the dll file. This will allow your IDE's intellisense to display Riptide's API documentation.
