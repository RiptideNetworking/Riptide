Message message Data that should be sent to the server with the connection attempt. Use Create() to get an empty message instance. bool useMessageHandlers Whether or not the client should use the built-in message handler system. Returns bool true if a connection attempt will be made. false if an issue occurred (such as hostAddress being in an invalid format) and a connection attempt will not be made. Remarks Riptide's default transport expects the host address to consist of an IP and port, separated by a colon. For example: 127.0.0.1:7777. If you are using a different transport, check the relevant documentation for what information it requires in the host address.

    "keywords": "Riptide.Transports.Tcp Namespace Provides a low level transport which communicates via TCP sockets. This transport is intended to act as a fallback for situations where Riptide's default UDP transport can't establish a connection. It primarily exists because Apple's app review center appears to have issues handling UDP traffic, with UDP-only applications frequently being rejected due to connection issues. Apple's devices do support UDP traffic—it's only their app review center that apparently doesn't allow UDP. To work around this, you can start by trying to connect with the UDP transport, and then automatically try again with the TCP transport if that connection fails. This way your end users should end up connecting via UDP, and TCP will only be used in cases where UDP doesn't work. This would obviously require a Server using the TCP transport to be running in addition to a Server using the UDP transport, as Servers cannot use both simultaneously. Important Due to its very niche purpose, the TCP transport has undergone limited testing and may have more unresolved issues than usual. Classes TcpClient A client which can connect to a TcpServer. TcpConnection Represents a connection to a TcpServer or TcpClient. TcpPeer Provides base send & receive functionality for TcpServer and TcpClient. TcpServer A server which can accept connections from TcpClients."

    "title": "Message Send Modes Explained | Riptide Manual",
    "keywords": "Message Send Modes Explained Riptide has three different message send modes (defined in the MessageSendMode enum) that you can use to send data. This article explains the differences between them and how & when to use them. The table below provides a quick functionality comparison: Send Mode Guaranteed Delivery Ordered Delivery Feedback Duplicate Filtering Unreliable ✗ ✗ ✗ ✗ Reliable ✓ ✗ ✓ ✓ Notify ✗ ✓ ✓ ✓ Unreliable Send Mode The most basic of the three send modes is the Unreliable send mode. It guarantees neither delivery nor order. When you send a message unreliably it is sent once and effectively forgotten about—nothing further is done to ensure order or delivery. Due to how the internet works, a message you send may sometimes get duplicated in transmission. Since unreliably sent messages aren't given a sequence ID, Riptide can't use said sequence ID to determine if a messages was already received once before. However, even if the unreliable send mode had a duplicate filtering system, it would not be able to catch duplicates which are sent maliciously with a unique sequence ID, so your server should be capable of receiving the same data more than once anyways. Usage The unreliable send mode is primarily useful for sending data which changes frequently and is being updated continually, such as a player's position. It doesn't really matter if a position update goes missing here and there due to packet loss as the next update is probably already in transmission, and resending the update that was lost to ensure its delivery wouldn't make much sense since it's already outdated information. Unreliable messages have message IDs built in, so you should use the Create(MessageSendMode, ushort) or Create(MessageSendMode, Enum) overloads when creating your message (replace <messageId> with your message ID): Message.Create(MessageSendMode.Unreliable, <messageId>); You can handle unreliable messages using static methods with [MessageHandler] attributes attached, or via the Server.MessageReceived & Client.MessageReceived events. Reliable Send Mode The Reliable send mode guarantees delivery but not order. When you send a message reliably, it is resent repeatedly under the hood until the other end responds and acknowledges that it received the message in question. Reliable mode assigns each message a sequence ID and uses that to (among other things) filter out duplicate messages on the receiving end. However, this duplicate filtering system will not catch duplicates which are sent maliciously with a unique sequence ID, so your server should be capable of receiving the same data more than once without breaking. Usage The reliable send mode is primarily useful for sending \"one-off\" data and data which changes less often, but whose delivery is important. Player chat messages are a good example of this. While reliable mode doesn't inherently guarantee order, you can manually ensure data arrives in the correct order by using the Connection.ReliableDelivered event to wait for the previous message to be delivered before sending the next one. This obviously comes at the cost of some added latency since you're sending messages and awaiting their delivery one at a time, but for something like player chat messages that likely wouldn't be an issue. You can identify messages by tracking the sequence ID returned by the Send method and comparing it to the one provided by the ReliableDelivered event. Reliable messages have message IDs built in, so you should use the Create(MessageSendMode, ushort) or Create(MessageSendMode, Enum) overloads when creating your message (replace <messageId> with your message ID): Message.Create(MessageSendMode.Reliable, <messageId>); You can handle reliable messages using static methods with [MessageHandler] attributes attached, or via the Server.MessageReceived & Client.MessageReceived events. Notify Send Mode Added in v2.1.0, the Notify send mode is the newest—but arguably the most powerful and versatile—of the three modes. It guarantees order but not delivery, and provides actionable feedback to the sender about what happened to each message. Notify mode guarantees order by simply having the receiver discard any out of order messages it receives. No packet buffering or reordering takes place on the receiving end. The sender invokes the Connection.NotifyLost or Connection.NotifyLost event depending on whether the message was lost or delivered, allowing you to determine what to do with that information. Messages discarded due to being received out of order are considered lost. Important The notify send mode includes its \"acks\" in the headers of other notify messages. This is more bandwidth-efficient than the reliable send mode (which sends separate unreliable ack packets for each message), but it means that both ends of the connection must send notify messages at a similar rate in order for it to work properly! Notify mode assigns each message a sequence ID and uses that to (among other things) filter out duplicate messages on the receiving end. However, this duplicate filtering system will not catch duplicates which are sent maliciously with a unique sequence ID, so your server should be capable of receiving the same data more than once without breaking. Usage The notify send mode gives you complete control by allowing you to decide what actions to take based on what happened to which data. For example, if a player's health changes twice in quick succession and the message containing the first health update is lost, you can avoid resending that data because you know you already sent a more recent health update. You can identify messages by tracking the sequence ID returned by the Send method and comparing it to the one provided by the NotifyLost and NotifyDelivered events. This level of control unlocks the ability to balance speed, reliability, and bandwidth-efficiency as necessary and makes it capable of replacing the other two send modes in the vast majority of situations. Notify messages do not have message IDs built in, so you should use the Create(MessageSendMode) overload when creating your message: Message.Create(MessageSendMode.Reliable); You can handle notify messages via the Connection.NotifyReceived event."

    "title": "FAQ | Riptide Manual",
    "keywords": "Frequently Asked Questions Below are some frequently asked questions as well as common issues which you may face when getting started with Riptide. If you can't find your question or the provided answer/solution is insufficient, feel free to join the Discord server and ask there! What's the difference between Riptide and other networking solutions? Riptide is a relatively low level networking solution—it gives you the tools to manage connections and send data, while leaving the rest up to you. This means you have full control over what happens, how it happens, and when it happens, but it also means you have to do more yourself. That might sound scary if you're just getting started with multiplayer game development, but it can actually be hugely beneficial for your learning process. This is in stark contrast to higher-level, more abstracted solutions, which provide more features and do more for you. However, this typically means you have less control over what your code is doing, and it may make learning how multiplayer games actually work more difficult because you're not exposed to what's going on under the hood. Whether you should use an abstracted, high-level solution or something lower-level like Riptide depends on what your needs and goals are. Do you want to see and be in charge of what's going on under the hood? Riptide is likely better for you. Do you just want to quickly build a multiplayer game without having to decide what happens and when? Then you may want to consider using something higher-level. Does Riptide cost money to use? No. Riptide is completely free to use, and it imposes no arbitrary concurrent user limits. You can connect as many players as you like, as long as the hardware your server is running on can handle it and you have sufficient available bandwidth. However, if you'd like to financially support Riptide's development and get early access to new features, you can do so through GitHub Sponsors. Can I use Riptide outside of Unity? Yes! Riptide is not dependent on Unity in any way, meaning you can use it pretty much anywhere you can run C# code. This includes .NET applications such as console apps as well as other engines like Flax Engine and Godot. What platforms can I use Riptide on? This varies depending on which low level transport you're using. Riptide's default transport uses UDP sockets and works on PC, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android. VR and consoles have not been officially tested to determine whether Riptide works on them, and at this point in time there is no web transport, meaning Riptide does not work in browser-based games. If you end up using Riptide's Steam transport, that obviously only works on platforms supported by Steam. How many players does Riptide support? This heavily depends on how much data your game needs to send per second per player and how that compares to the hardware and bandwidth available to your server. A turn-based card game would likely be able to support hundreds of times as many players as a fast-paced shooter while using the same resources. A big part of developing multiplayer games is choosing what data to send and when to send it. Riptide leaves that part up to you, so you're the one making those much more performance-relevant decisions of what and when. As a result, Riptide itself is highly unlikely to be your performance bottleneck. Does Riptide support player-hosted and lobby-based games? Yes! Riptide gives you the tools to manage connections and send data, but doesn't really impose any restrictions on how you do that. You can set up a dedicated server with full authority, a relay server which just passes on data it receives, a client that also acts as the host (server), or pretty much anything inbetween. The only architecture that would require some tweaks to Riptide's source is true peer-to-peer, where all clients in a lobby are connected to all other clients in the same lobby. Why am I not receiving any messages? Make sure that you're calling the server's and/or client's Update method regularly. Why am I getting a warning about no server-side/client-side method handler being found? If you're getting this warning, make sure you actually have a handler method set up for the message ID mentioned in the warning. If that doesn't help, chances are your handler method has the wrong parameters for what you intended it to be used for. Remember, server-side handler methods (which handle messages coming from clients) should have two parameters—a ushort and a Message instance. Client-side handler methods (which handle messages coming from a server) should have only one parameter—a Message instance. Alternatively, you may be getting this warning if you have chosen to handle messages via the MessageReceived event instead of using the [MessageHandler] attribute-based system. If this is the case, you can disable the attribute-based system by setting useMessageHandlers to false when calling Server.Start and Client.Connect. Do I have to use Debug.Log with Riptide's log system? No. You can use whatever log method you like, including Console.WriteLine, other engine-specific log methods, and your own custom log methods. All you have to do is pass your chosen log method to the RiptideLogger.Initialize method."

    "title": "Getting Started | Riptide Manual",
    "keywords": "Getting Started For a more complete tutorial on how to set up Riptide in your project, see this video. A lot of things were renamed in v2.0.0, which makes following along with the tutorial more difficult, so it's recommended to use v1.1.0 when watching the video and to use the upgrade guides to update your project afterwards. Tip The video tutorial uses two separate projects (one for the server and one for the client). This makes the separation between server and client very clear, which can be helpful when first getting into multiplayer game development. However, it's not ideal—especially for larger projects—due to the fact that it results in duplicated code and assets. This can be mitigated somewhat by setting up a local package for shared code, but combining server and client in the same project is just as doable and arguably easier to maintain. Initial Setup First of all, we need to tell Riptide how we want information to be logged so that we can see what our code is doing. We can do this using the RiptideLogger.Initialize method, which should be called before we do anything else with Riptide. If you're using separate projects for the server and the client, make sure to call it in both. RiptideLogger.Initialize(Debug.Log, Debug.Log, Debug.LogWarning, Debug.LogError, false); Obviously this is using Unity's logging methods, so if you're not using Unity for your project you'll need to replace the four log methods with Console.WriteLine or your engine's equivalent. Important This article explains the basics and includes various code snippets, but if you'd like to see these snippets in the context of a working demo, take a look at the NetworkManager classes in the dedicated server demo's server and client projects. Starting a Server To start a server, we need to create a new Server instance and then call its Start method, which takes in the port we want it to run on and the maximum number of clients we want to allow to be connected at any given time. You'll likely want to run this code as soon as your server application starts up. Server server = new Server(); server.Start(7777, 10); In order for the server to be able to accept connections and process messages, we need to call its Update method on a regular basis. In Unity, this can be done using the provided FixedUpdate method. private void FixedUpdate() { server.Update(); } Connecting a Client The process of connecting a client is quite similar. First we create a new Client instance and then we call its Connect method, which expects a host address as the parameter. Riptide's default transport requires host addresses to consist of an IP address and a port number, separated by a :. Since we're running the server and the client on the same computer right now, we'll use 127.0.0.1 (also known as localhost) as the IP. Client client = new Client(); client.Connect(\"127.0.0.1:7777\"); Tip Connecting to 127.0.0.1 will only work if your server and client applications are running on the same computer. To connect from a computer on a different network you need to connect to your host computer's public IP address instead, and you'll need to portforward to allow traffic from your clients to reach your server. Finally, we need to call the client's Update method on a regular basis, just like we did with the server. private void FixedUpdate() { client.Update(); } At this point, if you run the server and the client you should see log messages informing you that the server started and the client connected! Important Make sure you have the Run in Background option enabled (found under Edit > Project Settings > Player > Resolution and Presentation), otherwise your server and client will only be able to communicate with each other when their window is active/in-focus! This used to be enabled by default, but that appears to have changed in newer versions of Unity. Hooking Into Events Riptide's Server and Client classes both have several events to allow you to run your own code when various things happen. For example, you'll likely want your server to spawn a player object when a client connects and destroy it again when they disconnect. You can do this by subscribing your spawn and despawn methods to the ClientConnected and ClientDisconnected events. The Client class's most useful events are probably the ConnectionFailed and Disconnected events, which come in handy for things like returning the player to the main menu when their connection attempt fails or they're disconnected. For a complete list of available events, check out the server events and client events. Sending Data In order to send data over the network, it has to be converted to bytes first—you can't just send a string or an int directly. Riptide provides the Message class to make this process really easy. Creating a Message The first step of sending a message is to get an instance of the class. This is done using the Create method, which requires the message's send mode and an ID as parameters. Message message = Message.Create(MessageSendMode.Unreliable, 1); The MessageSendMode can be set to Reliable, Unreliable, or Notify. Due to how the internet works, not every packet a computer sends will arrive at its destination. Using the unreliable send mode means Riptide will send the message without doing anything extra to ensure delivery, which may result in some of these messages being lost. Using the reliable send mode will make Riptide track whether or not the message has been successfully delivered, and it will continue to resend it until that is the case. You can find more information about all three send modes in the Message Send Modes Explained article. Tip Your first instinct may be to send everything reliably, but at least in fast-paced games, the opposite is normally true—most information is sent unreliably. Consider the fact that even in an extremely basic setup where you simply send a player's position every tick, a newer, more up-to-date position message will have already been sent by the time a previous one could be detected as lost and be resent, and there's no point in resending outdated information. Message IDs are used to identify what type of message you're sending, which allows the receiving end to determine how to properly handle it. In the example above, we set the message ID to 1 (in practice you'd probably want to use an enum for message IDs instead of hard-coding the number). Adding Data to the Message To add data to our message, we can simply call the Add method for the type we want to add. For example: message.AddInt(365); The Message class has built-in methods for bits, all primitive data types (byte, bool, int/uint, float, etc.), strings, and structs which implement IMessageSerializable, as well as arrays of all these types. Any other types you may want to send should consist of combinations of these supported types. For example, a Vector3 consists of three floats (one for each component), so to add one to your message, you would simply call AddFloat three times, passing in the vector's three different components. Alternatively, you could write a custom extension method to make this easier, just like the ones included in the Unity package. Sending the Message Once you've added the data you want to include in your message, it's time to send it. Clients have only one Send method, while servers have Send and SendToAll (which has an overload as well). client.Send(message); // Sends the message to the server server.Send(message, <toClientId>); // Sends the message to a specific client server.SendToAll(message); // Sends the message to all connected clients server.SendToAll(message, <toClientId>); // Sends the message to all connected clients except the specified one Make sure to replace <toClientId> with the ID of the client you want to send the message to, or who you don't want to sent the message to if you're using the SendToAll method. Handling the Message There are two ways to handle messages. The first is with \"message handler\" methods. These are just regular static methods with a [MessageHandler] attribute attached. [MessageHandler(1)] private static void HandleSomeMessageFromServer(Message message) { int someInt = message.GetInt(); // Do stuff with the retrieved data here } Notice that we've passed 1 to the [MessageHandler] attribute. This tells Riptide that this method is meant to handle messages with an ID of 1, which is what we set our message's ID to in the creating a message part of this article. Important Whether a message handler method handles messages received from a server or a client is determined by its parameters. In order for a handler method to handle messages from clients, it must have two parameters (a ushort and a Message instance). In order for a handler method to handle messages from a server, it must have only one parameter (a Message instance). The code snippet above shows a client-side message handler, which will only handle messages received from the server. Alternatively, you can handle messages using the MessageReceived event. This option gives you extra flexibility with how messages are handled, and doesn't require you to use any static methods or attributes. If you choose this approach, make sure to disable the attribute-based handler system by setting useMessageHandlers to false when calling Server.Start and Client.Connect. Caution Data MUST be retrieved in the exact order in which it was added to the message! If you added an int, followed by a float and then another int, you must retrieve an int and a float before you can retrieve the second int. Mixing up the order will result in your retrieved values being completely different from what you added to the message."

    "title": "Installation | Riptide Manual",
    "keywords": "Installation There are a number of ways to install Riptide, depending on what you're working on and which tools you're using. Unity Option 1: Unity Package Manager Note Installing Riptide via Unity's Package Manager requires you to have git installed on your computer! In your Unity project, open the Package Manager (Window > Package Manager). Click the + (plus) button in the top left corner of the window. Select the Add package from git URL... option. Enter the following URL: https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide.git?path=/Packages/Core#2.1.0. To install a version other than v2.1.0, replace the 2.1.0 after the # with your chosen version number. Click 'Add' and wait for Riptide to be installed. If you have errors in your project after installation or intellisense isn't working for Riptide's classes, go to Edit > Preferences > External Tools, make sure the box next to Git packages is checked, and then click Regenerate project files. Tip If you'd like to use the latest in-development version of Riptide instead of an official release, enter https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide.git?path=/Packages/Core#unity-package in the git URL field. Keep in mind that doing this will get you the latest state of the repository, which may include bugs and incomplete features! Option 2: DLL File If you prefer not to use Unity's Package Manager or that option doesn't work for you, you can also install Riptide by manually adding the compiled dll file to your project. Either download the RiptideNetworking.dll file from the latest release (or choose a previous version), or clone/download the repository and build the solution yourself. Drop the RiptideNetworking.dll file anywhere into your Unity project's Assets folder. Optional: add the MessageExtensions class and add it to your project. It's included in the Unity package but isn't part of the dll file. Tip It's highly recommended that you also download the RiptideNetworking.xml file and drop that into your project alongside the dll file. This will allow your IDE's intellisense to display Riptide's API documentation. .NET Projects The following installation steps are for Visual Studio users and may differ if you use a different IDE. Option 1: NuGet Package Right click your solution in the Solution Explorer. Select Manage NuGet Packages for Solution... Click the Browse tab. Search for the RiptideNetworking.Riptide package and select it. Check the box next to the project(s) you want to add the package to. Choose the version you want to install from the dropdown. Click Install and then click OK when prompted. Click I Accept to accept the license terms. Option 2: DLL File Either download the RiptideNetworking.dll file from the latest release (or choose a previous version), or clone/download the repository and build the solution yourself. Right click your project in the Solution Explorer. Select Add and then select the Project Reference... option. Click Browse in the left sidebar of the window. Click the Browse button in the bottom right corner of the window. Navigate to the folder where you saved the RiptideNetworking.dll file and add it. Click OK. Option 3: Direct Project Reference Either download the RiptideNetworking.dll file from the latest release (or choose a previous version), or clone/download the repository and build the solution yourself. Right click your solution in the Solution Explorer. Select Add and then select the Existing Project... option. Navigate to the cloned/downloaded Riptide repository and open the RiptideNetworking.csproj file. Right click your project in the Solution Explorer. Select Add and then select the Project Reference... option. In the Projects tab (should be selected by default in the left sidebar), check the box next to RiptideNetworking. Click OK."

    "keywords": "Updating to v2 As a major version update, Riptide v2.0.0 includes a number of breaking changes. This means that updating will likely cause errors in your project and may result in your application behaving differently. To help make the update process go smoothly and seem less daunting, this article covers the behavior changes and what has been removed or renamed, as well as what you should use instead! You can also take a look at all the changes which were required to update the Sample FPS repo to Riptide v2.0.0. The git URL for installing Riptide via the Unity Package Manager has changed. See the installation instructions for more information. Logic and Behavior Changes The Client.Disconnected event is now invoked any time the client disconnects—including when Client.Disconnect is called—instead of only when the disconnection is caused by something outside the client (such as server shutdown, connection failure, etc). The default maximum message payload size has been reduced to 1225 bytes (from 1247 bytes) to ensure messages are smaller than the MTU. If you were sending messages which were close to the old size limit, those messages may exceed the new maximum and cause errors. Renames and Replacements Quite a lot was renamed in v2.0.0 with the goal of making names clearer and more intuitive. Things that were replaced but which have a direct equivalent that can be used are also listed below. Previous What to Use Instead Client.Tick Client.Update ClientMessageReceivedEventArgs MessageReceivedEventArgs ClientDisconnectedEventArgs ServerDisconnectedEventArgs ClientDisconnectedEventArgs.Id ServerDisconnectedEventArgs.Client.Id Common Peer HeaderType MessageHeader ICommon IPeer IConnectionInfo Connection Message.MaxMessageSize Message.MaxSize MessageSendMode.reliable MessageSendMode.Reliable MessageSendMode.unreliable MessageSendMode.Unreliable RiptideNetworking Riptide RiptideNetworking.Utils Riptide.Utils RiptideNetworking.Transports Riptide.Transports RiptideNetworking.Transports.RudpTransport Riptide.Transports.Udp Server.Tick Server.Update ServerClientConnectedEventArgs ServerConnectedEventArgs ServerMessageReceivedEventArgs MessageReceivedEventArgs ServerMessageReceivedEventArgs.FromClientId MessageReceivedEventArgs.FromConnection.Id Removals A few things were removed in v2.0.0 for a variety of reasons, some of which have alternatives or replacements but require a bit more explanation than those listed in the table above. Server.AllowAutoMessageRelay Property and shouldAutoRelay Parameter Reason: Having clients decide which messages are automatically relayed by the server was counter-intuitive, and it meant that as long as the server had AllowAutoMessageRelay set to true, any message could be made to be automatically relayed, even if it wasn't intended by the developer. Alternative: Servers that have a MessageRelayFilter instance assigned to their RelayFilter will automatically relay any messages whose IDs are enabled in the filter. isBigArray Parameter Reason: Manually setting the isBigArray parameter to true was extremely clunky and error-prone. Alternative: None, as this is done automatically now. Message.Bytes Property Reason: The Message class's backing byte array was only ever publicly accessible for use by transports, in case they needed to modify a message's data directly. The transport system's overhaul has eliminated this potential need, and having the byte array remain publicly accessible creates a risk for accidental misuse without providing any real benefit. Alternative: There is no direct alternative, but chances are you can do what you need using the AddBytes and GetBytes methods. LanDiscovery Class Reason: It was a mess and in dire need of an overhaul which would have involved breaking changes. By removing it, the removal is the breaking change (the necessary changes weren't going to make it into v2.0.0) and this way it can be re-added whenever, instead of having to wait for v3.0.0 to be revamped. Alternative: Currently none—it will be overhauled and re-added in a future update. If you need it for your project in the meantime, you can download the file from the old versions on GitHub and manually add it to your project. ActionQueue and DoubleKeyDictionary Classes Reason: They were unused. Alternative: None. RUDP Transport Classes Reason: As part of the transport system overhaul, transports are no longer responsible for reliable message delivery. This has been completely decoupled and reliability (among many other features) are now implemented on top of the transport, leading to a more consistent development experience between different transports and requiring less transport-specific implementations of features. Alternative: The UdpPeer, UdpServer, UdpClient, and UdpConnection classes which are found in the Riptide.Transports.Udp namespace."

    "keywords": "v2.0.0 Release Notes Install this version with Unity's Package Manager using the following URL (step-by-step instructions): https://github.com/RiptideNetworking/Riptide.git?path=/Packages/Core#2.0.0 It can also be installed a number of other ways for use outside of Unity, including as a NuGet package. For a full list of source code changes, check out the version comparison on GitHub. Additions Added a documentation site. Made a NuGet package (#12). Made it possible to accept or reject connections by setting Server.HandleConnection. Made it possible to send custom data when kicking a client (#20). Made it possible to retrieve connected clients by their ID using Server.TryGetClient. Added disconnect reasons. Added support for adding sbytes to messages. Added support for adding custom types to the messages class, as long as they implement IMessageSerializable. Added an option to disable the timeout system for individual connections using Connection.CanTimeout. Made it possible to change the maximum message payload size using Message.MaxPayloadSize. Added an option to disable dual-mode sockets for the UDP transport. Made the default transport's socket buffer size configurable. Added a TCP transport (primarily for use as a fallback in situations where UDP doesn't work). Changes Renamed a lot of things (including the base RiptideNetworking namespace—now it's just Riptide). For a full list of what was renamed, see the updating to v2 guide. Made calling Client.Disconnect invoke the Client.Disconnected event. Previously, this event was only invoked when the disconnection was not initiated by the client. Removed the isBigArray parameter from the Message class's Add/Get methods. This is now determined automatically. Reduced the default maximum message payload size to 1225 bytes (from 1247 bytes) to ensure messages are smaller than the MTU. Made Client.Connect return a bool to indicate whether a connection attempt will be made or an issue occurred (#39). Completely overhauled the transport system (which resulted in the removal of the RudpListener, RudpServer, RudpClient, and RudpConnection classes). For more information on the transport rework and all of the changes involved, see pull request #56. Made the default transport single-threaded, as the multithreading didn't provide much benefit but caused difficult-to-debug issues. Improved error handling. Made error messages more descriptive. Gave servers authority over which messages are automatically relayed. This is customizable via Server.RelayFilter. Removed customizable maximum send attempts for messages. In a future update, this system will be replaced by a system which disconnects clients if their connection health deteriorates too much. Removed LanDiscovery class. It will be overhauled and re-added in a future update. Removed unused DoubleKeyDictionary class. Removed unused ActionQueue class. Removed unnecessary custom type size constants. Made event args' properties readonly fields. Fixes Fixed some message handler methods not being found (#44). Sponsor Shoutout Thank you so much to all of my GitHub Sponsors for making this update possible, and an extra special thank you to the following individuals for their extreme generosity: oalpar those who wish to remain anonymous (you know who you are!) If you too would like to financially support Riptide's development and get access to various perks, you can do so through GitHub Sponsors. Thank you!"

For a full list of source code changes, check out the version comparison on GitHub. Additions Added the \"notify\" message send mode and overhauled message sequencing (PR #109). Added support for reserving (when writing) and skipping (when reading) bits in a message via ReserveBits and SkipBits, respectively (#103). Added support for setting and retrieving specific ranges of bits in a message, regardless of its internal write and read positions via SetBits and PeekBits, respectively. Use these with care, as accidentally setting or peeking bits in an incorrect range or at an incorrect position will scramble your data. Added support for adding bits to a message via AddBits. Added support for adding data to a message directly from another existing message via AddMessage. Added support for adding values to a message using a variable amount of bits (based on how large the value is) via AddVarLong/AddVarULong. Added an option to disable the [MessageHandler] attribute-based message handler system via the useMessageHandlers parameter in the Server.Start & Client.Connect methods. This is useful if you prefer to handle messages via the Server.MessageReceived & Client.MessageReceived events. Added an option to set timeout time per Connection. Added an option to specify the IP address that UdpServer and TcpServer should listen on (#26 and #79). Added the Connection.ReliableDelivered event for when a reliably sent message is successfully delivered (#42). Added bandwidth-related Connection.Metrics (#77). Added Reason to ConnectionFailedEventArgs. Added the Server.ConnectionFailed event for when a pending connection fails (#104). Added error logs for when the incorrect Create overload is used (#113). Changes Made the Message class operate on the bit-level instead of the byte-level. This allowed for a slightly reduced message header size and gives you more control over how much data you're sending (PR #121). Made poor connection quality trigger disconnections. This can be finely controlled via the Connection class's MaxAvgSendAttempts, AvgSendAttemptsResilience, MaxSendAttempts, MaxNotifyLoss, and NotifyLossResilience fields, or disabled entirely by setting CanQualityDisconnect to false. Deprecated the Message class's ReadLength, UnreadLength, and WrittenLength properties. Use ReadBits, UnreadBits, and WrittenBits instead. Changed Message.MaxPayloadSize setter's error logs to exceptions. Disabled Nagle's algorithm in the TCP transport. Removed the unnecessary 65 second limit on Connection.TimeoutTime and Peer.HeartbeatInterval. Made PriorityQueue<TElement, TPriority> publicly accessible and removed its internal use of List<T>. Removed the unnecessary AckExtra MessageHeader type. Stopped using DateTime for calculating timeouts. Updated DocFX to v2.70.1. Fixes Fixed improper duplicate filtering which allowed duplicates to be handled under certain circumstances (PR #109). Fixed unintended processing of subsequent connection attempts from connections that had already been rejected. Fixed incorrect processing of new acks for reliable messages. Fixed incorrect transport data buffer sizes. Fixed incorrect values that were used in some of the Message class's error messages. Fixed the size of PendingMessages not being changed along with Message.MaxPayloadSize. Fixed incorrect \"unknown reason\" rejection log when an already-connected connection was rejected (#84). Fixed errors that occurred when various Server properties were accessed before the first player connected (#86). Fixed the TCP transport's improper handling of large packets (#92). Fixed unhandled SocketExceptions when sending data, such as the one that occurred when a Client with no internet connection attempted to connect (#102). Fixed unintended timeout when a Client would disconnect and reconnect again in quick succession (#105). Fixed an infinite loop when a Server was started with a maxClientCount of 65,535 (#111). Fixed an issue with the TCP transport that caused connections to be rejected shortly after they were accepted and fully connected (similar to SteamTransport#1).
